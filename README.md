## Info:

This is a revamped project of the @AntifaChecker Twitter account that has been inactive for two years:
https://twitter.com/AntifaChecker/status/848364179304185856 

The purpose of this project is to continue the process of identifying bad actor antifascist Twitter accounts for people to easily block obvious fake/troll accounts. In turn, the project's Twitter account would only follow known and legitimate #antifa accounts with a goal of updating the follow list to include antifascist accounts that have established themselves since the original AntifaChecker's account went dormant.

Project Methodology

1) Block known fakes and bad actors
2) Follow known, well-established accounts

Account evaluations:
Checking the extended social graphs of real and fake accounts we can find new accounts to screen. Every account that is not 100% obvious is placed in a secondary screening list. If we still can’t tell, we take no action.

Current verification methods:
1) A known-good antifa account vouches.
2) Over xx% of known-good antifa accounts follow. The current threshold is 70% and positives are placed in a secondary screening list, since we don’t have a large enough sample yet.

Updates will be provided to inform about bad actor and fake antifa accounts as they are reported and evaluated.

In addition, we are working on a new shared block list to help people keep up to date more easily.
