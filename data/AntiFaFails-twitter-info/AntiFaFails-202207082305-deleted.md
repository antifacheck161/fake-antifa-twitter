HIPPA only applies to healthcare workers or clinic/hospital staff. HIPPA does not apply if some random person is talking about someone else so long as they do not have privileged information about that person from working with their medical care in some way. <!--1282780235256168448-->

America is sytemicly racist by having "protected class citizens". Demanding to be put ahead of anyone just because of a person's race is not equality. Groups telling white people they don't get a say are racist. <!--1277996967185055745-->

There have been tons of videos of blm "protesters" saying "k*ll wh*te people" or saying "no they don't" when someone else says "all lives matter" even shots of "protesters" screeching "White lives don't matter".

But if someone wants people to doxx someone else and they end up getting doxxed themselves that is fair by their own rules. Someone can't call for others to be doxxed and then be too surprised when it happens to them. pic.twitter.com/wvRZjKolO7 <!--1277617324711870473-->

"Average voters" don't pay enough attention to the truth before casting ballots. It's biblical.

By the new rules does that ass really think he can comment on her looks like that? & call her Elsa? Imagine the anger if she dropped to his gutter level and called him a stereotypical black name.

She also said what she's going to do is look at an argument from all sides, get all the facts, then speak. That's what any person should do. It doesn't mean you're a Centrist or a moderate.

The American holocaust known as abortion has killed 60,000,000+ innocent children.

He only freed most of the slaves in areas that seceded. If he could've preserved the Union without freeing them he would've.
