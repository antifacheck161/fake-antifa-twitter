His commentary of what it all means starts at about the 22 minute mark- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZLq4r4AuAs <!--1353893280900018176-->

It worked!  It's also been referenced in Supreme Court Cases, like Downes vs. Bidwell.... <!--1353892710503993345-->

Congress created that new government as a corporation, DBA "THE UNITED STATES."  In this way, they started to franchise out, just like McDonalds.  McDonalds is only incorporated in one state... <!--1353892427547897856-->

The Organic Act of 1871 did make a government for DC.  Congress is supposed to have exclusive legislative authority for that district under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17.  But that also gives congress power over.... <!--1353892066099519491-->

Literally can't get more of a swamp creature than that little Treasonous Monster Fauci. <!--1352868251978539008-->

DC is not part of the Union.  This doesn't look like a message to citizens so much as revolution against the "Elites." <!--1350254840958525442-->
* [ 9 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210109202159/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1348001972855611393): Bill Clinton's Whitehouse, right? <!--1348001972855611393-->

This is more like going for it on 4th and long in your opponents end zone, because you're down 13 and there is only 2:47 left in the 4th quarter. <!--1347713197269139456-->

They already said it 87 years ago. <!--1347681455468470272-->

* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107225004/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347314381734907904): It is one of the biggest infractions.  Most are set up to run the message automatically (within the allotted time frame) to eliminate any chance of "operator error." <!--1347314381734907904-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107224737/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347313580777955328): Um, that's kinda the point of being undercover, right?  How could they take that as anything other than "Whew, I'm not blown yet!" <!--1347313580777955328-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107195911/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347271274989436928): Only an idiot would think Trump has "no plan."  You could certainly debate about whether that plan is good for patriots and the country (at least questionable RN), but you don't get to be a billionaire president who goes to bed with a supermodel by having "no plan." <!--1347271274989436928-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107184243/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347252052670337025): LOL, you idiots already did that.    What's next, going to scream at the sky that "DRUMPF IS HITLER, DUUURRRR!!!" <!--1347252052670337025-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107173801/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347235421168623619): Well, supporters, yes.  Who didn't know that Antifa would hijack this event, just like Antifa has been doing for the past 3-5 years?    It was an obvious Trap, and anyone who was in DC walked right into it. <!--1347235421168623619-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107150630/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1347197653931577349): Yeah, but when you appear to "lose it all" by following traitors like Fauci and seeming to turn your back on base by endorsing (or not really fighting) small business destroying lockdowns....... well, hard to stay "loyal" to someone like that. <!--1347197653931577349-->
* [ 7 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210107002216/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1346975305387233285): Yeah, that happened back in Mid-March, thanks to America's Treasonous Governors, Mayors and "Health Officials." <!--1346975305387233285-->
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105211834/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1346566682148421632): Hate to burst your bubble..... but at least one study states the exact opposite. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-020-00680-7 <!--1346566682148421632-->
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105203332/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1346555356994965504): The US isn't much better, but hey, at least they had the decency to openly declare American Citizens "The Enemy" back in the 1933 Amendment to the "Trading With The Enemy Act."  So, at least the Federal Govt has been honest for 87 years. <!--1346555356994965504-->
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105200716/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1346548795052417024): No they don't.  They want "people" to think they are "persons." <!--1346548795052417024-->
* [ 5 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105200652/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1346548649212350464): The big secret is that the legal definition of "person" is basically that of a corporation.  That's why they use the plural "persons" and not "people."   These orders don't apply to men, women, or any other living soul, unless they accept them.  Most blindly do. <!--1346548649212350464-->
* [ 3 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103054043/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345605956722278400): As long as he's  #FiredUp , when is he gonna fire that treasonsous, murderous idiot Fauci, and start calling out this fake pandemic as a way to destroy small businesses, huh? <!--1345605956722278400-->
* [ 3 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103053422/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345604337804795906): When even your criminal allies have to call out some of your crimes, and try to do it in a positive manner. <!--1345604337804795906-->
* [ 3 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103015148/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345548242088386561): Well, he has since Mid-March.   When will we see the arrests and trials of America's Treasonous Governors, Mayors, and Health Officials? <!--1345548242088386561-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102182442/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345435824972726272): Medical mistakes such as this are insanely common.  I think "Medical Mistakes" are actually the third leading cause of death in the US, maybe even higher. <!--1345435824972726272-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102182317/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345435437964222464): No side effects?  Welp, better get rid of every single medical treatment in all of history, then. <!--1345435437964222464-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102174213/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345424970558521344): Then later, the 14th Amendment was passed, effectively making everyone slaves of the Federal Government. <!--1345424970558521344-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102023642/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345197209478778880): It's really the fact that he appears to have been outsmarted by deep state swamp monsters like Tony Fauci into beliving that a common cold virus is something to shut the country down for that has me more concerned.  He should have Fired Fauci and locked him up already. <!--1345197209478778880-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102020130/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345188366925455360): Please.  You saw all the voter fraud exposed.  They didn't vote for these criminals. <!--1345188366925455360-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102015937/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345187889609547776): It would appear Frankenstein's Monster has taken a hostage. <!--1345187889609547776-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102014827/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345185039902887936): There are certainly worse ways to go than "Chocolate Cookie Poisoning."  In fact, every other way to go may indeed be worse. <!--1345185039902887936-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102013737/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345182363823738880): Herman Cain died of cancer, moron.  Covid hasn't even been proven to exist. <!--1345182363823738880-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102013701/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345182197016272896): Oooooh!  I hyper contagious common cold?  I'm sure people are shaking! <!--1345182197016272896-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102013621/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345181982557261825): Good.  Covid is nothing more than a common cold at worst, non existent at best.  And there is zero proof it spreads (since it hasn't been proven to exist).  Good for people ignoring imaginary viruses, the same way they ignore bigfoot. <!--1345181982557261825-->
* [ 2 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210102010708/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345174687991570439): Any dead UN diplomat is likely a good thing.  Unless those diplomats are Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall. <!--1345174687991570439-->
* [ 1 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101231912/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1345147511049109504): Trump not firing this deep state swamp monster in Feb 2017, and then putting him on trial for treason on murder, is by far the biggest disappointment of his Presidency. <!--1345147511049109504-->
* [ 1 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101091107/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344878394329108482): Maybe it's the hope in me, but..... I still don't think Seth Rich is dead.  We know witness protection is a thing, and you have to have cover to be placed there......   In that sense, the Strawman SETH RICH had to die, even if the living soul continues to be among the living.... <!--1344878394329108482-->
* [ 1 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101071243/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344864569378832384): Who do you think you are, Wang Chung or something? <!--1344864569378832384-->

There is no proof it spreads at all.  Or even exists.  Remember, this is an imaginary common cold and flu virus. <!--1344805210904956928-->
* [31 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101020518/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344790787976957954): True.  And from 1992-2012, the GOP ran very weak presidential candidates.  And still Perot was needed to flip CA blue.  CA had a Republican Governor as recently as 2011.    Very likely that Cali is a Blue Mirage, maintained by voter fraud. <!--1344790787976957954-->
* [31 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101010942/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344679448503701504): No need to undo it, like every other social media "controversey," it will blow over in a week or so.  Bring it back up on February 15th, and see if anyone even remembers..... if you remember on February 15th. <!--1344679448503701504-->

* [31 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201231171252/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344678256809660416): That's because most cold and flu symptoms are caused by excess endotoxin, and Vitamin D is a TLR4 antagonist.  Every cold is basically very low grade sepsis, regardless of any microbial cause. <!--1344678256809660416-->
* [30 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201231161708/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344309277876391941): Let's hope so.  Far too many business owners and patriots complied with Tyrants like Fauci and Birx and Newsom and such.  Still upset that Trump went on TV everyday with known Traitor Fauci. <!--1344309277876391941-->
* [30 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201231191301/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344140253200752642): Of course it is.  Because there was an exponential increase in testing.  This is only a "Pandemic" for those that can't do math, or look at death figures in context.  Your 1.77 Million COVID deaths pale in comparison to the 18 Million Heart disease death this year, and every year <!--1344140253200752642-->
* [30 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201231030834/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1344139870139138050): You need to look at All Cause Mortality, Brain Genius.  It's easy to have a 25x increase in "Covid Deaths" if you test 25x more people before they die.   COVID is only associated (not Causal) with about 3% of total deaths this year, and the 56 Million total deaths are expected. <!--1344139870139138050-->

Patton was right, we did defeat the wrong enemy. <!--1344135629752291333-->

* [29 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230114944/https://twitter.com/AntifaBitcoin/status/1343951911897055234): Well, it is their enemy.  So it's true.  Considering people are declared "the enemy" of the government (look up the 1933 change to the Trading With The Enemy Act), why would you think you would be included when they say "our?" <!--1343951911897055234-->
