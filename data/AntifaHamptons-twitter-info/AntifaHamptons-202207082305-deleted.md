Foster was killed for no other reason than he mistakenly thought he could menace an innocent motorist with an AK-47.

But never harming anyone with the car. How do you explain that? <!--1289370006031962113-->

The protesters shouldn't have been in the roadway as that is a violation of law and could be used against them. Foster wasn't simply holding a rifle and any claims that he was are contradicted by the video. <!--1289369234292609024-->

The video clearly shows the car stopped and surrounded? The road wasn't closed to vehicles and pedestrians aren't exempt from the law.
