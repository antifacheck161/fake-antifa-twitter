Lyme, from everything I know is carried by a little tiny deer tick.  Still to this day I don’t think I ever got a rash from the bite. <!--1215171229788856320-->

If you see a bite, and feel under the weather, get checked.  If it progresses, it can damage your organs, including your heart.  You don't want to go through what I went through. <!--1215169306738249728-->

Tremors persisted, brain got foggy, slight speech problems.  (Finding words) In 6 months things started to get better, and at the 2 year mark I was 80%.

It was Lyme with coinfections, and it got into my nervous system.  28 days of one IV antibiotic.  No good.  Waited 30 days, switched to different IV antibiotic, and it cleared the infections in my blood.  The bad news was the nervous system problems <!--1215169302803963904-->

Five days later, the twitch in my right arm turned into a tremor with any fine movement.  Panic time.  Parkinson's, MS, or anything else I could think of.  I went to the dr the next day. He ruled out the big ones.... <!--1215169300757127168-->

I had felt run down for a while, but didn’t think anything of it.  One day I went to put a glass down on a table, and I had a little twitch.  Hmm.  Picked up the glass, put it down again, the same thing.  I thought I’ve never noticed that before... https://twitter.com/haileybieber/status/1215055358995005441 <!--1215169298081230849-->

I don't know about anyone else, but I don't want to play martyrdom Russian roulette with these people. <!--1213146309781274627-->

I do not think Iran, and its fanatical leaders, are rational actors. <!--1213145809707061248-->

If that means internal destabilization by military actions like this, I am all for it.   Russia, China, and even to a certain extent, lil rocket man, are rational actors. <!--1213145723723829249-->

I don't think this was an "assassination" as CNN put it, I think it was a preemptive military action.   I don't want a war with Iran in the conventional sense, and I do not want to see our troops put into harm's way.  BUT <!--1213145626705367049-->
