That seems a little messed up too. So, are you saying that only white men can punch down? <!--1481047104093143041-->

I'm Italian, do fully qualify as white. How about a white hispanic or "fellow whites"? Do they have privilege? Is this membership exclusive to skin color? In the summer I get really dark, do I lose it? <!--1481043867080220673-->

If you are really seeking racial equality, then do that. That is not what you are doing. You are advocating for victim groups. <!--1481039575355166720-->

Immutable traits are off limits, but only if you are white.  A white person standing up a to black person saying something racist is punch down.  A white person hits back at a (insert victim group here) from what they said, they should check their privilege. <!--1481038283673157633-->

That chip on your shoulder, or anyone's shoulder for that matter, is there problem, not mine.   Work on yourself, it's not up to everyone else to work around your personal issues. <!--1481035702909427712-->

The "flat-out punching down line" sure is telling. Are you saying that somehow black people are beneath whites?  Cause that sure reads like they are somehow a lower level of humans in your view.

Don't say you are stamping out hate, when what you are actually doing is advocating for a particular group. <!--1481031640667377664-->

So the question still exists. Did you report the tweets that were racist? All of the tweets, not just the white on black?  I doubt it, since you cheered her on. That's called being a hypocrite, and in actuality, a racist. <!--1481029605310050308-->

Having a perceived victimhood status does not make anyone, you included, immune from criticism.   A perfect example is that asshat, Simon. He isn't disliked by most because he's Jewish. He's disliked because he's a weirdo who happens to be Jewish. <!--1480994145166630912-->

I have just as much right to mouth off to some low IQ hood rat for racist "wyt" statements as you do for racist "XYZ" statements.   This shit goes both ways. <!--1480990796581060615-->

Don't even represent that you are tying to "stamp out hate" on all sides. You report things based on your personal biased views. I could care less if you are married to a person of color, but you on the other hand, seem to have a chip on your should about it. <!--1480988984159440903-->
