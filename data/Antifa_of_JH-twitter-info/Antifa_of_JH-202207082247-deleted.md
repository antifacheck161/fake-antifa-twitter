(on the engine side)  E10 and E15 are well tolerated in any injected vehicle, and E85 should not be used in anything that is not flex fuel enabled. E15 is probably about that limit of what can be trimmed out.   Specs?

As a guy who lives life over 30 psi, I run E85 exclusively. There is no issue with  #ethanol  and engines.   However, there can be issues with fuel system components found in older vehicles.  #Tucker  https://twitter.com/johnnschneider/status/1535413804569202690 <!--1535435137910988800-->
