I'm not a great fan of trade unions but it's his job to get more money for his members and I thought he answered your points well. You provoked him a lot and he didn't bite once.

It's unprincipled. All this nonsense just to relaunch Jamie's failing career. The man is a complete charlatan who is peddling unhealthy recipes and he needs to go on a diet. <!--1527958193879531520-->

Its justice system is rotten to the core. Around 95% of cases never get to court because of plea bargaining. The sentences there are ridiculous. The US legal system is totally bent. <!--1527790007779475457-->

We've taken the shame out of being fat so there are more fat people around as a consequence. In the old days you didn't get fat or else you'd be fat shamed. <!--1527279961383370753-->

It's immoral and a form of neo-colonialism. It's no better than taking food from a country that's experiencing a famine. <!--1527196058849247232-->

He seems to have hypnotised them all. What's going on? Can we have some truth about the WEF. Is it really the reincarnation of SPECTRE or SMERSH? <!--1527006976814743559-->

The Internet has created horizontal silos rather than vertical ones based on location, if that makes sense. The Internet has done this. <!--1526211769202507777-->

Two weeks ago, the EU held a conference and decided to set up an army. It's also doing away with countries having a veto and a load of other federal superstate shizzle is about to go ahead.

UEFA should lead by example but I can see it having to move to only accepting sponsorship from 'ideologically pure' sponsors.

Some of that money finds its way into Ronaldo's pockets. It's never good to bite the hand that feeds. If players start getting critical of sponsors, the sponsors may feel it damages their products.
