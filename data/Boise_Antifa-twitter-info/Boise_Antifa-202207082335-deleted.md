It's a fucked up republic situation while all the "great" thinkers of antiquity rallied against true democracy!   https://knowledgenuts.com/2013/11/29/prominent-greek-thinkers-actually-hated-democracy/   It's time for a paradigm shift! <!--1225354400178171905-->

It is still wrong to change what was. We must understand the past so that we understand what we now fight for in the future. <!--1221341224138706945-->

You speak beyond your station and marginalize so many who have been wounded, I hope you can reflect on your ideas and words- things that recreate all the pain and tragedy of those who have been victimized. <!--1218764859413692416-->

It's time to write new stories, our own stories & leave these fables from our sordid past behind.  We need our own stories, for our own world. <!--1218465902754025472-->

No hate, none at all. It was really cool and made me love living in Boise so much more. <!--1214462333717581829-->
