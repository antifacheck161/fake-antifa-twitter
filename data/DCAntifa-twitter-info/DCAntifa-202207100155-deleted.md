* [ 6 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220506142839/https://twitter.com/DcAntifa/status/1522584042033631234): @TuckerCarlson  really needs to just come out of the closet already. Dude is scrawny as hell, but is fascinated by buff male bodies. AND THAT'S OK! But suppressing that urge and weaponizing the shame he feels to hurt others who express it openly is NOT!  #GetTuckerOutOfTheCloset  https://twitter.com/NikkiMcR/status/1515130557675581442 <!--1522584042033631234-->

Both are wrong. Shame on you. <!--1497946909763330053-->

This is not anti-capitalism.   This is needless sowing of division. Nothing is accomplished here other than having the hottest take. <!--1431255050555383809-->
