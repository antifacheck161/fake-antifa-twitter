We can build something new. This won't work out.  The Democratic Party would throw the election to Trump rather than enact policies that even vaguely resemble anything socialist (or pro-worker).

This is how organizing works. I'm surprised by how few Biden supporters have bothered trying to sell us on their candidate. They don't seem to care about policy at all. <!--1234407090191507457-->

His Campaign schedule was filled with that.  Ugly truth but needs to be said. He wasn't interested in helping out the non elites supporting him. <!--1234406674334658560-->

Certainly don't want you to vote for the guy Biden who wrote the racist 94 Crime Bill. I'll sleep on it. It's really hard to think of nice ways to talk about politicians like him. <!--1234404102580396032-->

People are genuinely just tired of half measures like the watered down proposals Pete was offering. His voice was also annoying af to listen to. He also plagiarized Obama word for word like the phony he is. <!--1234403001009352704-->

All those empty platitudes he'd spew out in his stump speeches drove us nuts. One after the other. Seemed like a spook too. So we made fun of him, a lot.  Anywho...

He also works for the billionaire class. So there's that. Anyways, Pete supporters are switching sides to Sanders already, because who cares?
