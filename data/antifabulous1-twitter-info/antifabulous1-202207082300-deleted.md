Brown fits that definition and it is incredibly tragic. His skin played no role in his death, it was his character. <!--1159895441443569664-->

News flash, privatization is what we all do on a personal basis. You hire one person it’s public but two people as a company and it’s privatized. My point is the best comes when there’s a real incentive. <!--1153816092369797122-->

But lots more who are bad at it. All paid the same. Bad ones are nearly impossible to fire. Public options always err on the lowest standard rather than the highest. <!--1153812801854398464-->

Be honest. Most wouldn’t. That’s why the USSR sent so many to Gulags. No one wanted to work. <!--1153810273800581122-->

This is a severe double-standard. Stelter still claims to be unbiased. So does Don LeMON. At least people on Fox let you know what their opinions and leanings are. <!--1142859130509713409-->

I hated having to ask for help. But I would far rather have a friend or family member or leader to directly go to than a federal government. They can care for me and my needs specifically. Minimal beaurocracy. Better for the giver as well. <!--1141420513572655107-->

All the examples you gave are outrageous and horrible, no arguments coming from the left, right center I have heard on any of those in decades.

CNN is too busy defending its narrative to actually do real journalism. It’s hard to see that when you’re in the eye of the fake news storm so I don’t necessarily blame Cuomo.
