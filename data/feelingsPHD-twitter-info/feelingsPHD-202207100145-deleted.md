Your kind has always been performative rather than functional. "Look at me, a white boi fighting for the others." Sorry, not working. We don't need you. <!--923523191179444226-->

These Germans (Nazis???) are trying to say that maybe not everyone came from Africa.  https://t.co/JMHI4D5UDi <!--922210835388395526-->

I have always hated wine country. Shortly after takeoff my belly got very upset, which was odd. I ate before and after I got to the airport.  #Happened2MeOnAA <!--921475326437412865-->

Politicians are not able to serve the people as they are completely and unapologetically tethered to their donors. McCain gets huge bucks from tech and pharma/insurance. Things are profitable the way they are. So instead he starts pointless wars. <!--921024044476043266-->
