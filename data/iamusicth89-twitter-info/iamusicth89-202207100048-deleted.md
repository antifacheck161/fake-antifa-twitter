We will be having some licensed therapist coming by around 4 to our mental health tent today if anyone in the community needs assistance!

A lot of internet talkers who don‚Äôt actually show up. A part of the drama is over exhaustion of the main few doing it all every day. More hands would def help with all of our issues. <!--1283504600851439616-->

So for some rando  @Josie_Riot  who lives in a different city, and has NEVER been to the camp, to say I‚Äôm stealing from friends with zero proof is a sad attempt at a smear campaign. <!--1283304049077440513-->

Sure. Nice try. <!--1283263857570480131-->
