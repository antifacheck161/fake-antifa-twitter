"I'm beating you for your own good" "This hurts me more than it hurts you" "I wouldn't hit you if I didn't have to"  "Do you think I enjoy beating you? because I don't." <!--1316284894922723329-->

Just curious if you have any actual quotes or videos of Trump saying this?  Because until then it is literally a journalist pulling shit out of their ass to distract from the Antifa Murderer. <!--1302063320418021376-->

But luckily Aus signed onto the UN Declaration of Human Rights to freedom of assembly, speech and association.  Oh wait. <!--1301697641596690434-->

What crazy clown world have we come to where journalists are trying to gather news?  1. That isn't a plan, that's a plan to make a plan. 2.

And something tells me you're not going to focus on a certain far-right theocratic ideology that has the most extremists? <!--1233116707775897601-->

Most kids have been bullied in one way or another. South Park made an entire joke out of bullying Gingers like myself.

Why should he be trusted when he has had more political power than most will ever encounter for decades and has still not been able to do anything?   Sanders is impotent and ineffectual - why would anyone choose impotence over action? <!--1213982320748711936-->
