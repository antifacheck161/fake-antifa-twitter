But I haven't seen everything. And by everything, I mean earlier surveillance video, cell phone records and other communications records, etc.  Wild guess: Two Useful Idiots. One will flip.

A transfer is defined as: buy, sell, lend, borrow, or   otherwise provide, with or without consideration ($).
