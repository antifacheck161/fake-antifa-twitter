We have provable data that prohibiting drug use and production can stop drug use. <!--1528491265532186625-->

Anarchists do their own research and stop relying on talking points from libertarians: challenge failed https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470475/ <!--1528491011730681856-->

It harms them and everyone around them. 3. We should restrict it but not harm users. 4. This is easy and has been done all over the world with success. <!--1528490085309566976-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522213623/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528489885329281024): I'm gonna need a source on that one chief. And actually we have TONS of data proving that any number of prohibitions work. Most notably alchohol prohibitions in both America (don't make me get the stats on it you'll regret it, I've done more research on it than you) and in India <!--1528489885329281024-->

It was simply anarchists adopting what other more popular socialists were doing in. <!--1528488092851527680-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522212826/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528487769638457344): No one is entitled to anything resembling a right to drink (not saying you are saying that). And thus it's perfectly within the bounds of a democratic community to restrict it. <!--1528487769638457344-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522212639/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528487440880500736): It isn't "authoritarian" it's a democratic measure being voted on by the members of the community to restrict peoples ability to cause harm to themselves and the others around them. It's good and provably works. We don't need to harm users but we can stop the spread of alchohol <!--1528487440880500736-->

* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522190400/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528451349121142784): I mean you're not wrong but lol literally no anarchist revolution has ever happened without violence so it seem like that's gonna stay the same <!--1528451349121142784-->

* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522174908/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528432641434759168): No I have fun plenty of times throughout the day and I'm always sober so I wouldn't say being sober makes life either less or more fun. <!--1528432641434759168-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522174020/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528430477236785152): Whatcha mean? I don't think sobriety is fun, it's not why I support sobriety <!--1528430477236785152-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522173333/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528428746876760066): Nah you aren't entitled to any right to drink. Even moderate consumption of alchohol harms the brain and heart. Individualism is a lie <!--1528428746876760066-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522173306/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528428532463857664): Ah I see. Well fair enough then, I thought you were blanketing drug prohibition as only a thing of "white conservatism" despite it being a feature of a lot of indigenous communities, and african-american communities. <!--1528428532463857664-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522173055/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528428134508351488): Bruh it was literally a mass movement in favor of sobriety. That guy was dumb and wrong on this issue then, case closed <!--1528428134508351488-->

* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522173004/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528427073676582912): 1. No they don't which is good 2. They have a prohibition against both the consumption and production of even non hard drugs like marijuana 3. It's still banned, do you support banning it like the zaps or do you view this is an obvious act of restricting individual freedoms? <!--1528427073676582912-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522171808/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528424579206565888): Swedish socialist learns about Swedish socialist temperance movement: challenge failed <!--1528424579206565888-->

It is a still greater crime for a revolutionary for an insurgent to show himself drunk in the street"  Please stop talking out of your ass. <!--1528422297962311680-->

Also I can pull up direct quotes from Makhno on drinking if you want.   Zapatistas ban alchohol consumption, idk what to tell you. Please just learn how foolish anarchism is <!--1528247763204354048-->

Ultimately I don't believe everyone should in all instances be kept from drinking. Two guys on an oil rig alone on a weekend working a six month gig don't have the same moral obligation to not drink as a father of 2 <!--1528205142985564162-->

It's just bad for the health and well being of individuals. Socialists for hundreds of years have promoted sobriety. <!--1528201367847702528-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522022906/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528201124942974977): I don't think addicts should be excluded from any org or any activity. But that being said there are instances when being chemically addicted to a substance would be extremely harmful if you couldn't access ways to get off it, for example if you were a soldier and sent away <!--1528201124942974977-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522022735/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528200693013618688): I ain't arguing against joy. I'm arguing against doing things that actively harm the lives of their members completely unnecessarily (ie consuming drugs and/or alchohol). I believe sport, music, etc are far far far better for both organizing and for improving uality of life + fun <!--1528200693013618688-->

It was severely under enforced because of a lack of police but alas.   You aren't entitled to drink and localities and entities have a duty to stop any number of people from drinking when it harms them and others around them. The zaps know <!--1528199081440358400-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522021844/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528198512084516865): Bruh stop supporting Rojava and the Zapatistas then lol. They ain't anarchist and thank God for that lmao <!--1528198512084516865-->

I support banning alchohol consumption locally and largely in select spheres of the community we are apart of. He doesn't and he drinks but he understands I ain't gonna stop him. <!--1528198316831301632-->
* [22 May 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522021629/https://twitter.com/outsideantifa/status/1528197995769962496): I'm saying that organizing isn't something that should be mixed with drugs and alchohol because it provably impedes the health and mental well being of such organizers. We have lots of evidence for this.   War isn't fun and neither is revolution. You can't make it fun. <!--1528197995769962496-->

The life of my family isn't "petty shit" <!--1528196777169498112-->

So you've retreated from the "I'm not the police" point to "different material conditions justify it" point  Alchohol consumption during prohibition in America went down when it was enforced  It can absolutely work and no one is arguing that it should happen nationally <!--1528195270659346432-->

You aren't autonomous and you won't be able to do things that harm others or yourself, simple as. https://dorsetchiapassolidarity.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/zapatistas-the-prohibition-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-indigenous-territory/ <!--1528186047498137600-->

Actually we have lots of statistical data proving that banning alchohol use 1. works and 2. decrease rates of rape, child/spousal abuse, car accidents, violent crime, etc.   The zapatistas actually do this quite well. <!--1528185774255927297-->

No one is saying skating should be banned. It's plenty fun. But anarchists defend using alchohol and other very destructive drugs and substances under the absurd banner of "it's fun!"   So you support banning alchohol use during wars? <!--1528183465945882624-->

Won't read about a subject 2. Won't think critically about a subject 3.

Makhno explicitly argued that drinking on the front lines amounted to "treason"  Don't turn it into an idol, people ain't entitled to drink and should absolutely NOT be encouraged to do it. It's provably bad and ruins people and orgs <!--1528180475885260800-->
